# Chi-Squared G.O.F. Test Programs

There are two programs here, XSQGOF and XSQGOFT. They are different should both
be installed in order to function properly.

## Usage

1. Run XSQGOFT. This sets up your stats list editor (Stat-->Edit...) so that
you can use the XSQGOF program properly.
2. Go to Stat-->Edit... to and in the list labeled OBS, intput the observed
counts for the problem you're doing.
3. In the list editor, under the list EXP, input the expected PROPORTIONS
for the problem. NOTE: These are *not* the expected **counts**, those are
calcuated *automatically*.
4. Run the XSQGOF program. The two other lists will be filled with your 
expected counts (EXC) and the contribution scores (CNTRB) for follow up in
the problem.
