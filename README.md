# TI-84 Stuff

I got bored a lot and decided to make my life easier by writing programs for my 
TI-84. These programs mostly revolve around AP Stats and AP Chem and making 
possible AP problems for these classes much easier.

Each program has its own folder. Upload the .8xp file onto your TI-84 in order
to use these programs.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

It is probably necessary that you install the PTSTR and END programs on your calculator,
as many of my programs rely on this one.
