# Chi-Squared Test

This program is for doing a Chi-Squared homogeneity/independence test with
matrices.

## Usage

1. Input the Observed counts into matrix [A]
2. Run the XSQR program
3. It will output all the test information, whether or not the Null Hypothesis
can be rejected, and if the Large Sample Size (all expected counts >= 5) condition
was met.
4. All the Chi-Squared contributions will be stored in Matrix [C] for any follow
up.
